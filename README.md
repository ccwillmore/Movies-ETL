# Movies-ETL
  
###Project summary:  
  
The goal of the project is to extract data from two sources (Kaggle and data scrapped from wiki movies), clean the data, merge the data into data frames, and export the data to two tables of a postgres database.  
  
The data was delivered in 2 .csv files and 1 .json file.  Files are stored in the following locations:  
1. [wikipedia movie data](Resources/wikipedia-movies.json)  
2. [Kaggle movies meta data- zip file](Resources/movies_metadata.zip)
3. THe movie ratings file is too large to transfer to Git Hub.  It is stored in a separate folder on my computer.  The file is not available via Git Hub.  
  
The deliverable are 4 .ipynb files.  Screen shots of the resulting database are in the Resources folder.
